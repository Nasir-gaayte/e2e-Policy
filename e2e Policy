Introduction
Welcome to the e2e (emoney to emoney) app! This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our app. At e2e, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a secure experience. Our app does not require any login or collect any personal data from users. We operate independently and do not work with any government entities.

Information We Do Not Collect
The e2e app is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not:

Require users to create an account or log in.

Collect any personal information such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, or financial data.

Track or store user activity, transaction details, or location data.

How the App Works
The e2e app facilitates seamless eMoney exchanges between Golis Sahal and Somtel Edahab platforms. All transactions are processed directly between the user’s Golis and Somtel accounts without any intermediary storage or data collection by e2e.

Security
We prioritize the security of our app:

No Data Storage: Since we do not collect or store any user data, there is no risk of data breaches or misuse.

Secure Transactions: All transactions are processed securely through the respective mobile money platforms (Golis Sahal and Somtel Edahab).

Transparency: Users have full control over their transactions and can review details before confirming any exchange.

Third-Party Services
The e2e app integrates with Golis Sahal and Somtel Edahab systems to facilitate eMoney exchanges. These platforms have their own privacy policies and terms of service, which we encourage users to review.

Children’s Privacy
The e2e app is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect or process any information from minors.
